The promise is that it increases your typing speed and reduces the strain on your fingers.</p><p>I’ve switched my keyboard layout from QWERTY to Dvorak around five years ago. Learning a new layout is one of the most frustrating experiences that I’ve had so far. Muscle memory built up from touch typing on a QWERTY Layout for years meant that during the learning phase, I would constantly press the wrong key. My brain didn’t like that feeling — this is what I imagine a stroke victim must feel when relearning a basic skill.</p><p>It took me around two months to reach the proficiency I had touch-typing on QWERTY. I did not foresee that my QWERTY muscle memory would be replaced by Dvorak, making it frustrating to use other people’s computers — I had to search for keys and type with two fingers at an annoyingly slow pace. This made me aware of how often you use other people’s computers.</p><p>This also happens when someone else needs to use your computer, which involves a mandatory explanation of why you are using a different layout and switching it for every time the typist changes (which is frequent when collaborating on one computer).</p><p>The jury is still out on whether Dvorak improves typing speed. I find it hard to judge whether it did for me, mainly because I didn’t notice typing speed to be a limiting factor in my programming anyway. A far more valuable skill was the ability to touch type, but this isn’t tied to the Dvorak layout. One benefit of switching was that I wasn’t able to look at my keyboard to see which keys to press. This made me a better touch typist, though this could have been achieved just as well by using a keyboard with blank keycaps while maintaining the QWERTY layout.</p><p>I cannot judge if Dvorak helps with RSI issues as I never had them from typing, but it might be worth a shot. Perhaps the transition period when you are forced to type slower might be beneficial.</p><p>For me, the time investment of learning a new layout isn’t worth the benefits, especially given that you have to relearn QWERTY if you ever want to switch back. The experience of being a total beginner where you were previously advanced was rewarding, but if I could go back in time I would tell my past self: Don’t learn Dvorak; stick with the default. Guess now I’m stuck.</p></div></body></html>
