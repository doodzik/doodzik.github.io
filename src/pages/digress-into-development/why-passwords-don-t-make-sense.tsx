        <p>Passwords infuriate me.</p>

        <p>They are the most frustrating ritual on the web.</p>

        <p>Each new internet activity forces me to come up with one more thing to keep track of.</p>

        <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>

        <p>And every single service keeps me logged in forever. So after they sign me out I have to reset my password anyway.</p>

        <p>And therein lies another problem. I can reset my password with my email account. If it is breached all my accounts are.</p>

        <p>The majority of websites could just use email only authentication. No password handling to implement and most importantly one less password to remember.</p>
