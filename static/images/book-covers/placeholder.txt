# Book Cover Storage

This directory contains locally stored book covers for resilience against third-party site removal.

To download all book covers, run:
```bash
npm run download-covers
```

Each book cover should be saved as a .jpg file with a descriptive filename.
Book data in index.tsx should reference these local paths like:
`/images/book-covers/mindset.jpg`

This ensures the site remains functional even if external image sources become unavailable.
