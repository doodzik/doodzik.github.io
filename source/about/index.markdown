Hi everyone, I’m a software engineer living in Germany with about 4 years of experience.
I work as an independent developer and study applied computer science.
My expert area is full stack development.

In my spare time I like to code on personal and open source projects.
I love learning by mistakes, challenges and I’m always looking for opportunities to do awesome things.
