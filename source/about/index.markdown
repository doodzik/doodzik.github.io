Hi everyone, I am a software engineer living in Germany with about 5 years' experience.
I am currently a student of applied computer science and work as an independent developer.
My current focus lies on node and react, but I mastered countless other technologies in the development stack.
I'm especially interested in coming up with abstractions to minimize development time. 
Another thing I'm keen on is UX design.

In my spare time I enjoy working on personal and open source projects.
I love learning from mistakes and challenges. I am always looking for opportunities to do awesome things.
